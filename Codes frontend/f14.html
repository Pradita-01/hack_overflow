        <h1>Chhota Shigri Glacier: Water Level Information</h1>
        <p>This page provides detailed insights into the water levels at Chhota Shigri Glacier, including how they have changed over time and the factors that influence these changes.</p>
        
        <h2>Glacial Mass Balance</h2>
        <p>The Chhota Shigri Glacier has been losing more ice than it gains each year, a situation known as negative mass balance. This imbalance leads to increased melting and the formation of more glacial lakes. Over time, these lakes grow larger, significantly altering the landscape and contributing more water to downstream rivers.</p>
        
        <h2>Hydrological Changes</h2>
        <img src = "water.jpg" alt="water scarcity due to hydrological changes">
        <p>The glacier is a critical part of the local water cycle. As the glacier melts more rapidly due to rising temperatures, water levels in rivers initially increase. However, as the glacier continues to shrink, less water will be available, affecting agriculture, hydropower generation, and access to clean drinking water.</p>
        
        <h3>Long-Term Water Security</h3>
        <p>The ongoing loss of glacier mass poses serious threats to water security in the region. If the glacier continues to shrink, there will be less meltwater feeding the rivers, especially during the dry season. This reduction could lead to water shortages for millions of people living downstream, impacting their livelihoods and food security.</p>

        <h3>Impact on Local Communities</h3>
        <p>The changes in water levels due to the glacier's retreat are already affecting local communities. Farmers rely on predictable water flows for irrigation, and any disruption can harm crop yields. Additionally, the potential for glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) poses a significant risk to people and infrastructure in the region.</p>
